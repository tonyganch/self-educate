# Resources for self-education

As a self-taught developer, I often ask people: "How can I learn *this thing*?
Where should I go? What should I read?"    
An experienced colleague can quickly come up with a few good advice: a person
who's read dozens of books and tutorials can easily tell you, which of them are
worth your time.

In order to save you hours of googling, here are links to some amazing
resources.    
Feel free to update the list with any project that, in your opinion, will help
other people become harder, better, faster, stronger.

Want to learn Ruby? We have [a special page]({{ site.url }}/ruby) for it.    
And for [Python]({{ site.url}}/python) too.

## Paid but worth it

Sometimes you find a Book that changes your life: it gives you an amazing new
idea, or changes the way you see ordinary things, or just explains material
in a way that you can finally understand.    

- [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming
  Languages](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) —
  In this book you’ll get a hands-on tour of Clojure, Haskell, Io, Prolog,
  Scala, Erlang, and Ruby. Whether or not your favorite language is on that
  list, you’ll broaden your perspective of programming by examining these
  languages side-by-side. You’ll learn something new from each, and best of all,
  you’ll learn how to learn a language quickly.
- [Async JavaScript: Build More Responsive Apps with Less
  Code](http://pragprog.com/book/tbajs/async-javascript) — This book will give
  you a solid foundation for managing async tasks without losing your sanity in
  a tangle of callbacks. It’s a fast-paced guide to the most essential
  techniques for dealing with async behavior, including PubSub, evented models,
  and Promises. With these tricks up your sleeve, you’ll be better prepared to
  manage the complexity of large web apps and deliver responsive code.
- [Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of
  Thought](http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim) — Learn how to edit
  text the “Vim way”: complete a series of repetitive changes with The Dot
  Formula, using one keystroke to strike the target, followed by one keystroke
  to execute the change. Automate complex tasks by recording your keystrokes as
  a macro. Run the same command on a selection of lines, or a set of files.
