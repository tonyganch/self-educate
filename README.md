# Resources for self-education

As a self-taught developer, I often ask people: "How can I learn *this thing*?
Where should I go? What should I read?"    
An experienced colleague can quickly come up with a few good advice: a person
who's read dozens of books and tutorials can easily tell you, which of them are
worth your time.

In order to save you hours of googling, here we collect links to some amazing
resources.

## Contributing

Feel free to update the list with any project that, in your opinion, will help
other people become harder, better, faster, stronger.

File that you need to edit is `index.md`.    
Just find an appropriate group and add a link.    
Short and helpful descriptions are very welcome.

If you feel that some links should be moved to a new group, don't hesitate to
do so.
